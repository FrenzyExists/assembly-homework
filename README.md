# Assembly Homework

## This is my homework from the course Microprocessors 1 Fall 2022 at UPRM.

### The assembler we used is NOT the TI ones nor is a x86-based processor like you'll see around, but rather the MIPS assembler, which is based on the RISC architecture

#### Assignments

- Hello World
  
- Hello Name

Input:
  ```
  Hello -> the greeting
  <Hit-Enter>
  Pikachu
  ```
- Arithmetic
- Arithmetic 2

Accept user input to perform: X * 10 - 2 and print the result to the console.

X = Positive integers


- Floating Point 1

Accept user input to perform: X * 10 - 2 and print the result to the console.

X = Positive integers



Some random notes

So, even tho I'm sleepy here I am

A couple of days ago I had a conversation with an instructor in the TI lab from collegue, and told me about the ironing method for pcb design, which me said its common practice in Colombia in DIY pcb design. Gonna see if I can try it out, I want print my simple multivibrator already
