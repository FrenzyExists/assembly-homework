# Microprocessors Exams and Homeworks

This is my homework and exams from the course Microprocessors 1 Fall 2022 at UPRM.

Also I took the course with Prof. Luis Roa Pichardo

The assembler we used is NOT the TI ones nor is a x86-based processor like you'll see around, but rather the MIPS assembler, which is based on the RISC architecture. In terms of the contents, some assignments/exam exersices are in C language while others are in MIPS assembly. For MIPS you can get the MARS assembler, which is what I used. My classmates used qtsim because of the debugger. Whoever designed the UX/UI tho should be fired because its the worst user experience I ever had.
